Browse through AWS Official Webpage.\n What is Cloud Computing AWS Cloud Products  In this two weeks, you will use three AWS Products.\n Amazon WorkSpaces is used as a host to run the python project. Amazon SageMaker is used for running the given Notebooks, where you learn algorithms step-by-step. Amazon Braket is used for accessing quantum computing resources.  Setup Development Environment Step 1 : Download workspace client from https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/.\nStep 2 : Log into Amazon WorkSpaces with the given registration code. (If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the code, ask your mentor.)\nStep 3 : After login, you will see the desktop user interface. Now you are using a Amazon Linux system.\nStep 4 : Open a Terminal window.\nStep 5 : Execute the following commands in the Terminal to checkout project GitHub Repository and start running the project.\ngit clone https://github.com/guming3d/TSP-workshop-Original.git cd TSP-workshop-Original pip3 install -r requirements.txt python3 source/flask_app.py Step 6 : Open a web browser in the WorkSpace, visit http://127.0.0.1:5000, you should see a Web UI.\n Research about TSP Applications What Is the Traveling Salesman Problem? The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a problem that asks, with a list of stops and the distances between each of them, what is the shortest path/possible route that visits each location and returns to the origin?\nFor decades the TSP has been a challenge for many businesses that rely on route planning.\nWith just a starting point and a few stops, planning a route can seem complicated enough.\nBut once you start planning routes throughout the country, it reaches an almost unthinkable level of complexity.\nThis is what a route would look like if planned to every city in the US with over 500 inhabitants:\nJust imagine the number of possible routes you could take when a single possible solution is this complex.\nWhy the Traveling Salesman Problem Is Still Hard to Solve in 2022 Mathematician Karl Menger discovered the TSP in 1930, over 90 years ago.\nSince then, there have been many suggested solutions and algorithms. But they often struggle with the sheer scale, since the number of possible sales routes increases exponentially with each new stop.\nAnd the truth is, real route planning in 2021 for real businesses is more complex than just a list of stops — making things even more complicated.\nIn the real world, it’s not as easy as simply finding the shortest route.\nIt’s not just about destinations and distance, there are many other factors in play It’s not as easy as just taking a list of addresses and creating a route.\nA field sales rep, delivery driver, or technician also has to consider a lot of other factors, like time windows, vehicle capacities, and more.\nDelivery time windows and planned sales meetings What if your delivery drivers or salesperson have planned delivery times or sales meetings? Then it’s not enough to just consider the distance, you also have to factor in when they should be at each location.\nThis adds a whole new level of complexity, and is a challenge that most route planners simply can’t handle.\nThis particular instance of the problem is also known as the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW).\nRequired vehicle capacities or technician qualifications For deliveries, each package that you plan for can have specific requirements in terms of shipping and handling, from refrigeration to unloading dimensions.\nYou also have to consider the overall loading capacity of each vehicle.\nBut even for maintenance and field service businesses, you have to consider the unique qualifications of each technician, and whether they match a job.\nThis is also known as the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\nPlanning efficient routes that include both pickups and deliveries If your business delivers any sort of reusable packaging or recyclable materials to your customers, chances are that reverse logistics are a huge priority.\nTo maximize the efficiency of your business, you want to integrate both pickup and delivery into all planned routes.\nThis adds another dimension and a level of complexity that most route optimization tools can’t handle.\nThis is also referred to as the Pick-up and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (PDVRP)\nConsidering priority of leads, existing clients, and deliveries To run a business efficiently and keep VIP customers satisfied, you also need to make sure your staff prioritize things the right way.\nIf your routes don’t consider priority, every customer will be treated the same. So you risk alienating loyal customers if you suddenly switch to an automated solution that can’t handle that.\nBalancing workloads between multiple drivers Of course, when planning routes for multiple drivers, you also have to consider their workloads.\nDrivers are only human, and have a maximum shift length of 14 hours and mandatory breaks.\nWhat good is an “efficient route” if it’s not possible for a driver to handle it within the allotted time?\nGood workload balancing tools will help you reduce overtime and cut driver costs, and make sure all drivers are HOS-compliant at all times.\nPlaying with the code for the simplified TSP problem Step 1 : After logging into your AWS console and click the link for Amazon Braket\nStep 2 : Next, click the button to Create Notebook\nStep 3 : Let us create a notebook instance and fill the name with k12-interncamp-tsp-quantum\nStep 4 Select Instance type. Braket notebook provides multiple instance types of different computational power and prices. The default setting is enough for most of our chapters.\nStep 5 Choose create the role for this notebook since this is the first time you use this service\nStep 6 Checkout the given GitHub Repo. A Jupyter notebook version of this book for fitting SageMaker is available at https://github.com/AoyuQC/k12-interncamp-tsp-quantum.git. We can specify this GitHub repository URL to let Braket notebook clone this repository during instance creation. After that, Please click the button to crete the notebook.\nStep 7 It may take a few minutes before the instance is ready. When it is ready, you can click on the “Open Jupyter” link.\nStep 8 Open the notebook and go to the k12-interncamp-tsp-quantum/application/tsp/Introduction_to_TSP.ipynb to learn something about TSP\nStep 9 After finishing your work, do not forget to stop the instance to avoid extra cost.\nAfter all this practice, let\u0026rsquo;s do some background research. Find at least 5 real-world problem related to TSP. You should be able to describe the use cases.\nOnboarding to Quantum Computing We will try to solve TSP problem with quantum computing(QC) resource in the second week.
